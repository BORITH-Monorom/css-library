## Usage

To use this CSS library in your project, you can link to it directly using a CDN. We recommend using **jsDelivr** for a fast and reliable connection.

Simply add the following line to the `<head>` section of your HTML file:

```html
<link rel="stylesheet" href="[https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/BORITH-Monorom/css-library@main/style.css](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/BORITH-Monorom/css-library@main/style.css)">
